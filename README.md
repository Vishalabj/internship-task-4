Task 4: SQL Joins – Chinook Database

This task demonstrates SQL joins using the Chinook database.
INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN queries are used to solve business problems such as:
- Combining customers with invoices
- Identifying customers with no purchases
- Calculating revenue per track
- Genre-wise revenue analysis
- Region-wise sales analysis

The Chinook database tables were mapped as:
orders      -> invoice
order_items -> invoiceline
products    -> track
categories  -> genre
